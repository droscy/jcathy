Description: Simple cataloguer for removable devices
 This program creates a catalog of files and folders of removable devices
 (or folder in the system) and stores them in a database, assigning a
 unique identifier (chosen by the user) to that volume.
 .
 This database can be searched later by file/folder name to get the name of
 the volume which that file/folder belongs to, so users can easily locate
 their files.
