Description: Simple cataloguer for removable devices
 With this program you can retrive the list of files and folders of a
 removable device (or a folder in the system) and stores them in a database,
 assigning a unique identifier (of your choice) to the volume being catalogued.
 .
 This database can be later searched by file/folder name to get the name of
 the volume which that file/folder belongs to, so users can easily locate theirs
 files over a huge list of volumes.
