Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
 jCathy creates a catalog of files and folders of removable devices
 (or folder in the system) and stores them in a database, assigning a
 unique identifier (choosen by the user) to that volume. This database
 can be searched by file/folder name to get the name of the volume which
 that file/folder belongs to, so users can easily locate theirs files.

 * 0.7.3 [????]
     o Volumes can now be renamed


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Building:
   * Java SE JDK v1.6 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html)
   * Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)

 Running:
   * Java SE JRE v1.6 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html)
   * HyperSQL v1.8.0 (http://hsqldb.org/)


Building and Installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 To build jCathy you need to have Jave SE JDK and Apache Ant installed
 on your system.

 Once done open a shell terminal (like DOS Command Prompt on Windows, or
 Konsole on GNU/Linux) move to the folder containing the source tree of
 jCathy and simply execute 'ant'.

 After a successfull building, create the subfolder 'lib' in the same folder
 of jcathy.jar and copy in there the file hsqldb.jar downloaded from the
 HyperSQL website. On Windows you can simply double-click on jcathy.jar to
 start the program, on GNU/Linux edit the file jcathy on line 49, set the
 path to your jcathy.jar file and execute it with './jcathy', that file can
 be copied to /usr/bin for a simpler command-line execution.

 To install jCathy move the tree folder
  - jcathy.jar
  - lib
  - lib/hsaqldb.jar
 wherever you want in the system. The actual database will be created in the
 same folder with name jcathy.db.properties and jcathy.db.script.


Uninstalling
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Removes the files jcathy.jar, hsqldb.jar and, on GNU/Linux, the file jcathy.


Source Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 To create the source package of jCathy, you can execute 'ant source'.
 Two file will be created
  - jcathy-${version}-src.tar.gz
  - jcathy-${version}-debian.tar.gz
 the first contains the only the main sources, the second contains the
 debian subfolder required to build Debian packages.


Note for Debian-based distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The sources are provided with the "debian" subfolder, and the building of
 jCathy in a Debian-based system can be done using the common Debian building
 tools. First of all install the following packages:
  - build-essential
  - debhelper
  - ant
  - java-sdk
  - devscripts
  - quilt
 you don't need to download HyperSQL because it is installed with the Debian
 package libhsqldb-java.

 To build jCathy execute (in the source folder)

    quilt push -a
    debuild binary
    sudo dpkg -i ../jcathy_${version}_${arch}.deb

 where ${version} is the current version of jCathy and ${arch} is your system
 architecture (i.e. i386, amd64, ...)


Usage
~~~~~
 Add a Volume:
   Open jCathy, go to the "Catalog" tab select the source root to be catalogued
   by clicking the "Browse" button. Then choose a name for this volume and
   click on "Add" button. Do this for each volume you want to store.
   The "Ignore" field can be used to ignore some files/folder whose name
   matches the pattern: these files/folder will not be indicized.

 Search files/folders:
   Open jCathy, go to the "Search" tab, enter the pattern to be searched (you
   can use the asterisk * as a jolly character) and click on "Search". The list
   of files/folders with the choosen name will be listed. Click on one of them
   and go to the "Explore" tab, there you can navigate the whole tree for that
   volume.
