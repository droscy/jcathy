Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
 jCathy retrives the list of files and folders of a removable device
 (or a folder in the system) and stores them in a database, assigning a
 unique identifier (choosen by the user) to the volume. This database
 can be searched by file/folder name to get the name of the volume which
 that file/folder belongs to, so users can easily locate theirs files.


ChangeLog
~~~~~~~~~
 * 0.7.3+svn (under development)
     o Added this README and this Changelog
     o Created debian subfolder to build and install this program in
       Debian-based systems
     o ...

 * 0.7.3 [????]
     o Volumes' names can now be changed


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Building:
   * Java SE JDK v1.6 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html)
   * Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)

 Running:
   * Java SE JRE v1.6 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html)
   * HyperSQL v1.8.10 (http://hsqldb.org/)


Building and Installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 To build jCathy you need to have Jave SE JDK and Apache Ant installed
 on your system.

 Once done open a shell terminal (like DOS Command Prompt on Windows, or
 Konsole on GNU/Linux) move to the folder containing the source tree of
 jCathy and simply execute 'ant'.

 After a successfull building, create the subfolder 'lib' in the same folder
 of jcathy.jar and copy in there the file hsqldb.jar downloaded from the
 HyperSQL website. On Windows you can simply double-click on jcathy.jar to
 start the program, on GNU/Linux edit the file jcathy on line 49, set the
 path to your jcathy.jar file and execute it with './jcathy', that file can
 be copied to /usr/bin for a simpler command-line execution.

 To install jCathy move the tree folder
  - jcathy.jar
  - lib
  - lib/hsaqldb.jar
 wherever you want in the system. The actual database will be created in the
 same folder with name jcathy.db.properties and jcathy.db.script.


Uninstalling
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Removes the files jcathy.jar, hsqldb.jar and, on GNU/Linux, the file jcathy.


Note for Debian-based distributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The sources are provided with the "debian" subfolder, and the building of
 jCathy in a Debian-based system can be done using the common Debian building
 tools. First of all install the following packages:
  - build-essential
  - debhelper
  - ant
  - java-sdk
  - devscripts
  - quilt
 you don't need to download HyperSQL because it is installed with the Debian
 package libhsqldb-java.

 To build jCathy execute (in the source folder)

    quilt push -a
    debuild binary
    sudo dpkg -i ../jcathy_0.7.3-1_${arch}.deb

 where ${arch} is your system architecture (i.e. i386, amd64, ...)
